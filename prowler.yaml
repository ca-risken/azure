        Ensure clusters are created with Private Endpoint Enabled and Public Access Disabled
        - In a private cluster, the master node has two endpoints, a private and public endpoint. The private endpoint is the internal IP address of the master, behind an internal load balancer in the master's wirtual network. Nodes communicate with the master using the private endpoint. The public endpoint enables the Kubernetes API to be accessed from outside the master's virtual network. Although Kubernetes API requires an authorized token to perform sensitive actions, a vulnerability could potentially expose the Kubernetes publically with unrestricted access. Additionally, an attacker may be able to identify the current cluster and Kubernetes API version and determine whether it is vulnerable to an attack. Unless required, disabling public endpoint will help prevent such threats, and require the attacker to be on the master's virtual network to perform any attack on the Kubernetes API.
      recommendation: |-
        To use a private endpoint, create a new private endpoint in your virtual network then create a link between your virtual network and a new private DNS zone

        Ensure Network Policy is Enabled and set as appropriate
        - All pods in an AKS cluster can send and receive traffic without limitations, by default. To improve security, you can define rules that control the flow of traffic. Back-end applications are often only exposed to required front-end services, for example. Or, database components are only accessible to the application tiers that connect to them. Network Policy is a Kubernetes specification that defines access policies for communication between Pods. Using Network Policies, you define an ordered set of rules to send and receive traffic and apply them to a collection of pods that match one or more label selectors. These network policy rules are defined as YAML manifests. Network policies can be included as part of a wider manifest that also creates a deployment or service.

        Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) Client Authentication and Azure RBAC where possible.
        - AAD client authentication is considerably more secure than token-based authentication because the tokens must be persistent at the client. AAD does not require this.
      recommendation: |-
        Map all the resources that currently access to the Azure Cosmos DB account with keys or access tokens. Create an Azure Active Directory (AAD) identity for each of these resources: For Azure resources, you can create a managed identity . You may choose between system-assigned and user-assigned managed identities. For non-Azure resources, create an AAD identity. Grant each AAD identity the minimum permission it requires. When possible, we recommend you use one of the 2 built-in role definitions: Cosmos DB Built-in Data Reader or Cosmos DB Built-in Data Contributor. Validate that the new resource is functioning correctly. After new permissions are granted to identities, it may take a few hours until they propagate. When all resources are working correctly with the new identities, continue to the next step.

        - The Global Administrator role has extensive privileges across all services in Microsoft Entra ID. The Global Administrator role should never be used in regular daily activities, administrators should have a regular user account for daily activities, and a separate account for administrative responsibilities. Limiting the number of Global Administrators helps mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, reduces the potential impact of human error, and aligns with the principle of least privilege to reduce the attack surface of an Azure tenant. Conversely, having at least two Global Administrators ensures that administrative functions can be performed without interruption in case of unavailability of a single admin.

        Ensure only MFA enabled identities can access privileged Virtual Machine
        - Managed disks are by default encrypted on the underlying hardware, so no additional encryption is required for basic protection. It is available if additional encryption is required. Managed disks are by design more resilient that storage accounts. For ARM-deployed Virtual Machines, Azure Adviser will at some point recommend moving VHDs to managed disks both from a security and cost management perspective.
      recommendation: '1. Log in to the Azure portal. Reducing access of managed identities attached to virtual machines. 2. This can be remediated by enabling MFA for user, Removing user access or • Case I : Enable MFA for users having access on virtual machines. 1. Navigate to Azure AD from the left pane and select Users from the Manage section. 2. Click on Per-User MFA from the top menu options and select each user with MULTI-FACTOR AUTH STATUS as Disabled and can login to virtual machines:  From quick steps on the right side select enable.  Click on enable multi-factor auth and share the link with the user to setup MFA as required. • Case II : Removing user access on a virtual machine. 1. Select the Subscription, then click on Access control (IAM). 2. Select Role assignments and search for Virtual Machine Administrator Login or Virtual Machine User Login or any role that provides access to log into virtual machines. 3. Click on Role Name, Select Assignments, and remove identities with no MFA configured. • Case III : Reducing access of managed identities attached to virtual machines. 1.

Deleting or purging a Key Vault leads to immediate data loss, as keys encrypting data and secrets/certificates allowing access/services will become non-accessible. There are 2 Key Vault properties that play a role in permanent unavailability of a Key Vault: 1. enableSoftDelete: Setting this parameter to 'true' for a Key Vault ensures that even if Key Vault is deleted, Key Vault itself or its objects remain recoverable for the next 90 days. Key Vault/objects can either be recovered or purged (permanent deletion) during those 90 days. If no action is taken, key vault and its objects will subsequently be purged. 2. enablePurgeProtection: enableSoftDelete only ensures that Key Vault is not deleted permanently and will be recoverable for 90 days from date of deletion. However, there are scenarios in which the Key Vault and/or its objects are accidentally purged and hence will not be recoverable. Setting enablePurgeProtection to 'true' ensures that the Key Vault and its objects cannot be purged. Enabling both the parameters on Key Vaults ensures that Key Vaults and their objects cannot be deleted/purged permanently.

        Ensure that 'OS and Data' disks are encrypted with Customer Managed Key (CMK)
        - Encrypting the IaaS VM's OS disk (boot volume) and Data disks (non-boot volume) ensures that the entire content is fully unrecoverable without a key, thus protecting the volume from unwanted reads. PMK (Platform Managed Keys) are enabled by default in Azure-managed disks and allow encryption at rest. CMK is recommended because it gives the customer the option to control which specific keys are used for the encryption and decryption of the disk. The customer can then change keys and increase security by disabling them instead of relying on the PMK key that remains unchanging. There is also the option to increase security further by using automatically rotating keys so that access to disk is ensured to be limited. Organizations should evaluate what their security requirements are, however, for the data stored on the disk. For high-risk data using CMK is a must, as it provides extra steps of security. If the data is low risk, PMK is enabled by default and provides sufficient data security.
      recommendation: |-
